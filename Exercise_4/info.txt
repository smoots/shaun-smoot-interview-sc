Vault Population Steps
======================

On each SWARM node running your vault container set thr Vault Address variable

export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

On the first node run the init command:

vault operator init

This will dump your Keys to unseal and connect to the Web UI (if needed) example below:

Unseal Key 1: p9ySCyRaHXUhQQAw3PgkQhSvoe+mexRlZGILDi2ieLji
Unseal Key 2: a8IQbNnbUWLx5mK//nkG0NIO4XtYbeqOFnS7R1STJhQg
Unseal Key 3: 4Q+qgYNYTRqER5NdrzFwyYSmI6ZcQ4qYcvat0YKCGqJB
Unseal Key 4: AlXy7LO1Nyxxp5GAVYe2MEusk8chXJb/q0rnT5hxOsB6
Unseal Key 5: XHtoC4husOQCwXNEyT4Du6D9zF6T2UJgEWVRoCC/62kr

Initial Root Token: 213d7dad-c2fd-de83-61bf-bcc9ab43d480

Vault initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 3 of these keys to unseal it
before it can start servicing requests.

Vault does not store the generated master key. Without at least 3 key to
reconstruct the master key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!

It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
existing unseal keys shares. See "vault operator rekey" for more information.

Next login into vault, using:

vault login p9ySCyRaHXUhQQAw3PgkQhSvoe+mexRlZGILDi2ieLji

Next populate secrets for postgress admin:

vault kv put secret/pg pgpass=PGPASSWD2468!
